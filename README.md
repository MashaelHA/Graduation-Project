We looked at the missing guideline tourist aspect of the Eastern Province. The eastern region includes several regions, each section  is a region and contains places and a description of those places. We chose to have the artificial intelligence part of the help button as a chat bot. Also, if the user is not logged in and does not have an account assigned to him, Can't take advantage of all the services of 
the application.
We focus on tourism because itâ€™s the important role it plays in contributing to the economic growth of any country, and it is defined as local tourism if it is inside the country or foreign tourism if it is an international destination, and this may be for a purpose work, pleasure, or treatment. This sector has become a major source of income for many countries. And it contributes significantly to building and supporting other sectors. Tourism is a very important aspect not only for the country's economy but for its global position, as many people link the development of countries in terms of the development of the tourism sector with them. Therefore, we find that tourism is always a thriving sector in all developed countries. The homeland remains the best destination for tourism economically, socially and security-wise, and because the success of tourism depends on an integrated system of ingredients, and in a manner that suits the development witnessed by the Kingdom and befits the development stage in which it is living, and in a manner that contributes to achieving our strategic goals in achieving development sustainable in all its content, whether in its social, economic or environmental aspect, such as the availability of housing, restaurants, cafes, markets, various entertainment venues, the mechanism of reservation and access, and others, in addition to the presence of various activities and cultural and social events that characterize each region, to reflect its identity, and the type of heritage and culture prevailing in its local community , especially that the Kingdom is full of different environments in which cultures are colorful and some customs differentiate between regions, making them rich in their heritage and civilization. But there is a problem, which is the lack of a guide for visitors in the eastern region, and this creates several obstacles and problems in domestic tourism in the eastern region due to the lack of knowledge of tourist places, Therefore, the tourist faces many problems. We will design a special program for the eastern region in it All tourist places, hotels, restaurants, and others are available in the region to serve as a guide to discover and help anyone to visit the Eastern Province and guide them so that they see it in the best possible way and plan and support tourism in the region. Therefore, we will work to develop and promote tourism in the 
Eastern Province.




## Problem Statement

The problem we seek to solve is strengthening the tourism aspect in the Eastern Province, which means promoting domestic tourism in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia so that we can contribute to achieving the vision of our country from the tourism side. We focus on this problem because we looked at the missing tourist aspect of the Eastern Province specifically. There are several special places in the eastern region, but the visitor or tourist does not know them because there is no guide for the area. The role of our application is to solve this.
